= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on Microsoft Hyper-V

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) nodes on Microsoft Hyper-V.

== Prerequisites

You must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

You will also need a small utility from https://github.com/containers/libhvee[libhvee] called `kvpctl`. It attaches your Ignition config to your virtual machine. Precompiled binaries can be found on the project's https://github.com/containers/libhvee/releases[releases page].

=== Downloading the disk image

Hyper-V disk images can be manually downloaded from the https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/download/[download page]. Be sure to decompress the image after downloading.

== Booting a new VM on Microsoft Hyper-V

=== Creating a virtual switch

You must first create a virtual switch so your virtual machine has a network to connect to. To do this, launch Hyper-V Manager and select your server from the list:

Then click _Virtual Switch Manager..._ in the _Actions_ panel:

Follow the prompts under _New virtual network switch_ to create the virtual switch of the type you want:

=== Creating a virtual machine

In the Actions panel of Hyper-V Manager, click _New_, then _Virtual Machine..._:

This will launch the _New Virtual Machine Wizard_. When completing the wizard, note the following settings:

. If you select a Generation 2 virtual machine, see <<Configuring Secure Boot>>.
. When prompted to configure networking, select the virtual switch you created earlier.
. When prompted to connect a virtual hard disk, select _Use an existing virtual disk_ and specify the disk image you downloaded earlier:

=== Setting the Ignition config

Before starting your virtual machine for the first time, you must attach your Ignition config containing the customizations you want to apply to Fedora CoreOS.

On Hyper-V, the Ignition config is presented to the hypervisor in parts. Ignition reads the parts and reassembles them into a single config. You can use the `kvpctl add-ign` subcommand to create these parts and attach them to the virtual machine. The syntax for the command is as follows:

[source, powershell]
----
.\kvpctl.exe <name_of_vm> add-ign <path_to_ign_file>
----

For example:

[source, console]
----
> .\kvpctl.exe myvm add-ign C:\Users\joe\myvm.ign
added key:  ignition.config.0
added key:  ignition.config.1
added key:  ignition.config.2
added key:  ignition.config.3
added key:  ignition.config.4
added key:  ignition.config.5
added key:  ignition.config.6
----

=== Starting the VM

Once you've attached the Ignition config to the virtual machine, right-click the virtual machine in Hyper-V Manager and select _Start_.

=== Viewing the key-value pairs assigned to your virtual machine

You can view the key-value pairs assigned to your machine with the `kvpctl get` subcommand. You can only get key-value pairs when the virtual machine is running.

[source, powershell]
----
.\kvpctl.exe <name_of_vm> get
----

For example:

[source, console]
----
> .\kvpctl.exe myvm get
ignition.config.3 = th":"/etc/containers/registries.conf..."
ignition.config.4 = ,"contents":{"source":"data:,makeste..."
ignition.config.5 = nabled":false,"mask":true,"name":"do..."
ignition.config.6 = service\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr..."
ignition.config.0 = {"ignition":{"config":{"replace":{"v..."
ignition.config.1 = default.target.wants","user":{"name"..."
ignition.config.2 = "user":{"name":"root"},"contents":{"..."
----

=== Configuring Secure Boot

If you configure a Generation 2 virtual machine, Fedora CoreOS will not successfully boot until you change the Secure Boot template to _Microsoft UEFI Certificate Authority_. You can do this in the _Security_ tab of the virtual machine's Settings dialog:
